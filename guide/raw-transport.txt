# Raw Transport

The Raw Transport uses a specified network interface as the emulation
boundary entry/exit point.

## Features

The Raw Transport emulation boundary provides the following set of
features: [Network Interface Raw
Read/Write](#network-interface-raw-readwrite), [Virtual Transport
Interoperability](#virtual-transport-interoperability), [Bitrate
Enforcement](#bitrate-enforcement), [Broadcast Only
Mode](#broadcast-only-mode), and [IPv4 and IPv6
Capable](#ipv4-and-ipv6-capable).

## Network Interface Raw Read/Write

The Raw Transport uses a specific network interface as the emulation
boundary entry/exit point. The network interface can be a physical
interface, virtual interface, tunnel, etc. The interface is managed
external to the Raw Transport.

Any traffic read from the interface will
be delivered to the Raw Transport's respective *NEM* for emulation
processing.

## Virtual Transport Interoperability

The Raw Transport supports interoperability with ~{{link name="Virtual
Transport" file="virtual-transport.md" section="#virtual-transport"}}~
emulation boundaries using ARP caching to learn IP network to *NEM Id*
associations.

### Bitrate Enforcement

The Raw Transport supports bitrate enforcement for use with models
that do not limit bitrate based on emulation implementation. Set the
configuration parameter `bitrate` to the desired rate in `bps` to
enable bitrate enforcement or 0 to disable.

### Broadcast Only Mode

The Raw Transport supports forced *NEM* broadcasting of all IP
packet types: unicast, broadcast and multicast. Set the configuration
parameter `broadcastmodeenable` to `true` to enable broadcast only
mode.

### IPv4 and IPv6 Capable

The Raw Transport supports IPv4 and IPv6 packet processing.
