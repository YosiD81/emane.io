# emane-guide

The *emane-guide* is for anyone interested in using the [Extendable
Mobile Ad-hoc Network Emulator
(EMANE)](https://github.com/adjacentlink/emane) for research and
development of wireless communication systems.

The *emane-guide* assumes that you are familiar with basic wireless
communication concepts and have a working knowledge of the Linux
command line. The material presented throughout the guide is done in
a broadly accessible manner and is designed to be read in sequence,
with each chapter building on the previous.

The *emane-guide* comes with a set of examples, so you will want to
clone the latest version and give each a try.

```
git clone https://github.com/adjacentlink/emane-guide
```

Some sections of the guide that focus on internal and external APIs
will make more sense if you have a programming background,
specifically experience with C++, Python, and Google Protocol
Buffers. None of which are a prerequisite for using EMANE, but if you
want to develop radio models or tools that interact with EMANE,
proficiency with each will be helpful.
